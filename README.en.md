# Knowledge Base 🐥 Freelancer (2003) [RU](README.md)

## What is it ❓

- Everything you need for creating modifications of the game `Freelancer (2003)`, as well as everything required for exploring the game’s lore.

## What’s inside ❓

1. I don’t like the fact that this portal is adapted only for the `English` language, with no support for `multilingualism`, including `Russian` or `Chinese`.

   - After all, Russian and Chinese players have been making their own mods for over a decade, and in my version there is an `opportunity for multilingual support`.

2. This fork may `significantly` `differ` from what the original public archive represents – I have worked through its English version alongside the Russian one to keep a `respectful` attitude towards everyone who has ever contributed, `but` within the development of the `Lizerium` portal I have recreated all `167` pages (as of `02.09.2025`) into Russian versions, preserving their functionality and translations.
3. This project is synchronized with my [Lizerium portal](https://lizup.ru/wiki), `so that` `it` `can` work as a multilingual portal. For that, tools were developed to support:

   - `Mermaid`
   - `Offset filtering`
   - `Markdown embeds`
   - And `others`

     - The project no longer relies on the technologies (`Docusaurus`) that `The Starport` once used.
