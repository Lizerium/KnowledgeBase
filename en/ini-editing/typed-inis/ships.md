### Overview

Although `shiparch.ini` and `rtc_shiparch.ini` are listed as having configurable locations in `freelancer.ini`, ships used by NPCs _must_ be in the default `shiparch.ini` file or crashes may occur.

#### Vanilla Examples

- `DATA\SHIPS\shiparch.ini`
- `DATA\SHIPS\rtc_shiparch.ini`

#### Ship Handling

Ship handling is dictated by several keys found in the `[Engine]` block from [equipment](./equipment.md), as well as keys attributed to the `[Ship]` entry itself. The `mass` of a ship attenuates any change in speed and influences behaviour when colliding with other objects. `rotation_inertia` operates in much the same manner, but for turning.

`rotation_inertia` should typically be between 10 to 20% of `angular_drag` to avoid strange behaviour from the autopilot.

Where `linear_drag` = the sum of engine and ship `linear_drag` values:
$Strafe\ Speed = strafe\_force/(linear\_drag)$

$Max\ Turn\ Speed = steering\_torque/angular\_drag$

$Top\ Speed = max\_force†/linear\_drag$

†Value is defined in an [equipment](./equipment.md) entry.

| nickname         | How this simple object is referenced elsewhere in the game's files.                                                                                              |
| DA_archetype     | The path to the archetype model to use for the simple. Typically a .3db or .cmp file.                                                                            |
| material_library | The path to a material library (.mat) file that the `DA_archetype` uses. Missing .mat files will cause the ship, or parts of the model to render inconsistently. |

| ship_class                          | A value between 0 and 3. Determines the ship class displayed in the dealer where 0 = 'Light Fighter', 1 = 'Heavy Fighter', 2 = 'Freighter', 3 = 'Very Heavy Fighter' and 4 =                                                                                                                           |
| nickname                            | The internal nickname of the ship, i.e. how this will be referred to elsewhere in the game's INI files.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| msg_id_prefix                       | References an ID prefix such as 'Liberty Heavy Fighter' for use when stations/other ships are hailing one another. These entries are typically found within [voices](./voices.md), with the sound files themsevles contained within binary UTF files.                                                  |
| mission_property                    | Determines what the ship is able to dock to. Valid options seem to be `can_use_berths` (Which allows the ship to use docking rings), `can_use_med_moors` and `can_use_large_moors`.                                                                                                                    |
| type                                | Seems to influence NPC `attack_preference` values in [pilots_population.ini](../hardcoded-inis/data/missions/pilots.md). There are also suggestions that this influences NPC behaviour when in formation. Observed values are `FIGHTER`, `FREIGHTER`, `TRANSPORT`, `CAPITAL`, `GUNBOAT` and `CRUISER`. |
| mass                                | The mass of the ship. This value attenuates any changes in speed that the ship makes. A higher value results in greater attenuation.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| hold_size                           | The cargo size of the ship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| linear_drag                         | 'Drag' applied to the ship when you are moving. `linear_drag` on the ship applies even when in engine kill mode.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| fuse                                | A fuse applied to the ship. Values here are typically a [`fuse`](./fuses.md), a delay in seconds and a hit_pts threshold for the fuse to trigger.                                                                                                                                                      |
| max_bank_angle                      | The maximum bank angle permitted when turning. This value is defined in degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| camera_offset                       | Y and Z axis of the camera offset from 0 for the ship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| root_health_proxy    | Decides whether any damage applied to this collision group is also applied to the root object, too. `true` applies the damage to the root object, `false` does not forward the damage and keeps it just to this group.                                                                                            |
| explosion_resistance | Defines a factor by which damage caused by explosions is multiplied. Defaults to 1. 0 means no explosion damage is applied ever.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| linked_equip         | When this collision group is being destroyed, it causes damage to a type of equipment on the ship. The first entry accept a defined set of equipment types, which are: scanner, engine, weapon, shield, thruster, power, light, tractor, attached_fx, internal_fx, tradelane, repairdroid, cloaking_device, armor |
