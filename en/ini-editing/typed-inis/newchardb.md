title: Newcharacter
---

## Overview

The newcharacter ini type is used to define player data in multiplayer servers upon creation of a new character. It is very closely related to _mpnewcharacter.fl_ found in the EXE folder.

### Vanilla Examples

- `DATA\CHARACTERS\newcharacter.ini`

## Syntax

Each of the following sections can only be written once in the order shown.

:::caution

Tinkering with _newcharacter.ini_ is often unreliable; Freelancer is very picky with this file and can cause odd bugs if modified.

| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| nickname  | Must always match the value of _Pilot_ in the [Faction](#faction) section.                                                                                                                                       |
| body      | Reference to a **Costume** (see [costumes](costumes.md) for available costumes). A male costume is suggested because of differences between the male and female skeletons.                                       |
| comm      |
| voice     | Reference to a **Voice** (see [voices](voices.md) for available voices). It is highly recommended to keep _trent_voice_, since the player's character has additional voice messages not defined in other voices. |
| body.anim | Reference to a set of animations for the body. _Sc_MLBODY_STND_000LV_A_31_ is the default and recommended value.                                                                                                 |

| ship       | Reference to a **Ship** (see [ships](ships.md) for flyable ships).                                                                                                                    |
