## Overview

### Vanilla Examples

- `DATA\UNIVERSE\universe.ini`

## Syntax

Entries should be written in the order they are presented here. `[Base]` entries should be loaded before their corresponding `[System]` ones, as Freelancer will look for the bases in a system when it's loaded on launch and will throw a `get_base() failed` error if it's not already been defined.

### Time

```ini
[Time]
seconds_per_day = INT
```

| Parameter | Information                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time      | This value does not appear to be used. It's speculated that day/night cycles were planned at some point in Freelancer's development and this value is a lefover from that. |

| ship_sml_01        | Determines the `$ship_sml_01` ship model used in the base's traffic thorn script. This is not used in vanilla but functions as expected.                                  |
