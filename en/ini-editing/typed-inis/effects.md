### Overview

These files govern effects and the sounds attached to them, their types, as well as the texture and ale components of effects. `[BeamSpear` and `[BeamBolt]` blocks can also be used to directly create simple beam effects.

#### Vanilla Examples

- `DATA\FX\WEAPONS\weapons_ale.ini`
- `DATA\FX\beam_effects.ini`
- `DATA\FX\effects.ini`
- `DATA\FX\effect_types.ini`

### Syntax

`[EffectType]` blocks should always be called before everything else, followed by `[VisEffect]`. These are usually called in a seperate ini file as defined in [freelancer.ini](../hardcoded-inis/exe/freelancer.ini.md).

#### EffectType

:::caution

The number and names of `[EffectType]` blocks are actually hard coded, and cannot be changed or added. The `[EffectType]` block does however, allow you to define the properties of each type.

:::

```ini
[EffectType]
nickname = STRING
priority = INT
generic_priority = INT
lod_type = STRING
radius = INT
visibility = STRING
update = STRING
run_time = INT
pbubble = INT, INT
```

| Parameter        | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| visibility       | Determines the visibility of the effect. Options are `EXIST_OFFSCREEN` or `CULL_OFFSCREEN`                                                                                                                                           |
| update           | Determines whether the effect is updated when offsceen. Options are `UPDATE_OFFSCREEN` or `CULL_UPDATE`                                                                                                                              |

| pbubble          | Determines the maximum and minimum view distance of the effect. Note that any radius higher than the hardcoded maximum draw range or the maximum effect view distance will not be used, defaulting to the hardcoded maximum instead. |
