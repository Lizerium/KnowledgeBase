Welcome to The Lizerium Wiki! This place is a global repository of technical and modding knowledge on Freelancer. A snapshot of the English version of this Wiki as of 2025-07-23 is taken from [this repository](https://github.com/TheStarport/KnowledgeBase). It is not dynamically updated (yet), translated into Russian and runs on .NET, other translations are also available. I think it's time to break down language barriers between developers.
