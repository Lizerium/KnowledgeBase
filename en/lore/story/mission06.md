## Mission Available

Once this mission becomes available, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Rheinland Leaves Negotiations
> The summit on Curaçao was brought back into session only to have it halt abruptly as Gunther Obst from Rheinland refused to re-enter the grand hall. Instead, Obst went into a closed-door, coded meeting with Chancellor Niemann, where he still remains.

#### Summit Ends in Conflict
> Chancellor Niemann spoke today, insisting on the immediate departure of Gunther Obst from the Curaçao summit and dispatching several wings of fighters to escort him home. The Chancellor repeated earlier accusations against Kusari and all but accused Liberty of participating in a conspiracy to weaken Rheinland. He then declared Rheinland borders closed to all Kusari citizens traveling in or out.

#### More Violence in Omega
> Rheinland forces again lashed out against Bretonian patrols. This time our ships fired back, crippling several Rheinland vessels. Chancellor Niemann decried the altercation as an act of hostility against the Rheinland state.

#### Kusari Citizens Arrested
> Reports indicate that soon after the Chancellor’s recent address, many Kusari citizens in Rheinland were placed under arrest “for their own safety.” Shogun Edo of Kusari was reportedly outraged at this news and demanded their immediate release. There has been no response yet from the Chancellor on this matter, but Queen Carina is also appealing for their release.

#### Surge in Local Artifact Sales
> Local Artifact dealers report a marked increase in Artifact sales in recent weeks. Some of this, they say, can be attributed directly to Liberty’s imposed ban on their trade. However, they have also noticed an unusual number of foreign buyers, particularly from Rheinland. Sales topped at a record high again this week.

#### Jacobi Addresses Rheinland
> President Jacobi responded to Rheinland’s recent closure of its borders with stateswoman-like aplomb. In her address, she asked Chancellor Niemann to reconsider this decision, to cease all hostile activities, and to release all Kusari citizens who are being held against their will. There has been no reaction yet from Rheinland.

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Curaçao Delegates Return Home
> In light of recent events, all remaining delegates of the Curaçao summit have been recalled to their respective Houses. The Queen reaffirmed her support for the summit proceedings, hoping that when it resumes, it will act as an instrument to reestablish better understanding and lasting peace.

#### Assassin Commits Suicide
> DNA samples taken from the would-be “Order assassin” match those of a Bretonian man reported missing in the Border Worlds five months ago. Hollings O’Keefe, who was apprehended after he opened fire on the Curaçao delegates, apparently died from a Cardamine overdose in his cell. O’Keefe, who had no criminal record before this incident, leaves a legacy of questions, since he died before authorities could learn any details about his disappearance or his subsequent connection to The Order.

#### Kusari Convoy Attacked
> A Kusari convoy near the Kusari/Rheinland border fell to a Rheinland attack wing earlier, eliciting a blistering rebuke from Shogun Edo. The ships, which were on the Kusari side of the border, are said to have been carrying Food and medical supplies to one of Kusari’s outposts when the attack occurred.

#### Carina Decries Actions
> Queen Carina spoke out against the recent attack of a Kusari medical convoy. In her statement, she appealed to Chancellor Niemann to end his aggression with Kusari and to work with the other colonies to find a more peaceful solution to their differences.

#### Niemann Defends Actions
> Chancellor Niemann finally addressed the issue of Rheinland’s recent attack of a Kusari medical convoy. In his statement, he said that the Kusari convoy was operating under direct orders from the Kusari government to implant a “weapon of mass destruction” near an unspecified target in Rheinland space. Therefore, he said, this defensive attack was deemed necessary to preserve Rheinland lives.
