After ending Mission 4 the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Ballenshine Pronounced Dead
> Liberty Secretary James Ballenshine collapsed today and was evacuated to a government medical unit, where he was pronounced dead of natural causes. President Jacobi said that his sudden passing will not diminish Liberty’s commitment to peace and stability in the colonies. She will now be attending the summit meeting on Curaçao in his place.

#### Rheinland Blockade in Omega
> In an unprovoked move, Rheinland has imposed blockades on Jump Gates in Omega-7. Officials have called this “an outrageous breach of trust and protocol that we cannot stand for.” Queen Carina and her cabinet have called for the Chancellor to immediately withdraw his forces, now impinging on Bretonian interests in that area. “Though we have been tolerant thus far,” the Queen said, “this hostile act casts a dark shadow on our relationship and will be met with equal force if need be.”
