## Mission Available

Once this mission becomes available, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Freeport 7 Manifest Found!
> The Freeport 7 data manifest has been found, according to the LSF. Agents finally discovered the sought-after module in a palette of wreckage reportedly salvaged by the Junkers. The data manifest, we are told, was acquired and immediately taken to the LSF labs for analysis. Based on the extracted data, investigators are certain that Orillion was indeed on Freeport 7 just before its destruction.

#### Rheinland Fortifies KU Border
> There is what can only be described as a Rheinland Military buildup on their side of the shared border with Kusari. Chancellor Niemann says he will defend Rheinland against any more Kusari-based incursions even if it means taking matters into his own hands. Kusari, denying any wrongdoing, has deployed ships as well and adopted a defensive stance of its own in response to this action.

#### Liberty, Bretonia Propose Summit
> Recent action on the Rheinland/Kusari border has caused other colonies great concern. In answer to this, President Jacobi and Lord Quigley of Bretonia have jointly proposed an emergency summit meeting to bring about a peaceful settlement. Lord Quigley, who has had a long career in successful diplomatic negotiations, is said to be acting under the direct wishes of his cousin, Queen Carina. There is no word yet on the Chancellor’s response to this proposal.

#### Manifest Exposes Orillion
> Based on its most current evidence and testimony, the LSF believes that Orillion, a.k.a. Sam Lonnigan, came to Freeport 7 to steal several large shipments of unusually expensive goods and Artifacts that were in its bays. Once his agents took control of the shipments and presumably eliminated their rightful owners, it is believed that he ordered the ships to take off and destroy the station to cover their tracks. Lonnigan was likely to have been the last to leave. However, for whatever reason, he was caught in his own trap and was injured in the blast. Lonnigan was brought to Liberty by rescue ship and was admitted to the WCMC. Local Order operatives liberated him from Ward 13, and after his quick recovery, they implemented a wave of terror using Manhattan as a new base of operations. The LSF now says that it has all it needs to identify Lonnigan’s accomplices, who may still be at large.

#### Boorman Treaty Violated?
> Shogun Edo now insists that Rheinland’s continued military actions show them to be in complete violation of the Boorman Treaty. Edo’s tone was almost accusatory in itself, as he asked why Liberty refused to help the Kusari people. The President, in fact, did speak to both powers today, asking them to reduce the buildup at their borders and to present their respective issues at the proposed summit meeting.

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Curaçao Summit is Now Set
> With Rheinland finally agreeing to attend, the summit meeting is now moving forward. Delegates, including our own Secretary Ballenshine representing Liberty, are to attend the meeting on Curaçao sometime in the coming week.
