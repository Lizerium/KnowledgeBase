### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Doctors Hold Off LSF Inquiry
> A group of `Freeport-7` survivors, many of whom were critically injured, were taken to the `Williams-Creek` Medical Center for treatment. There they were triaged, and some underwent emergency, life-saving procedures. Agents of the LSF were also on hand to question those who could talk, but doctors insisted that they be allowed to recover before being subjected to the added stress. `The LSF acquiesced` but insisted that these patients be kept in a secure location within the medical center. Doctors have set aside `Ward 13` for their convalescence.

#### Schultzky Killed in Manhattan
> Rheinland Admiral Otto Schultzky has been assassinated `by members of The Order`! The President was visibly shaken when she heard that the ship carrying the Admiral was `totally destroyed` on its final approach to Newark Station. After extending her condolences to Rheinland, she ordered a full inquest, immediately charging the LSF to pursue The Order as `its number one priority`.
