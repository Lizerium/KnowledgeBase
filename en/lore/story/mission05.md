### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Lord Quigley Gunned Down
> We are stunned by the news that Lord Arnold Benson Quigley, Foreign Minister to the Crown of Bretonia, has been found brutally murdered in his home. The Queen was informed and has firmly charged investigators to find those responsible. This is a duty, we are assured, they have solemnly accepted. Thus far there are no official suspects. However, an off-the-record source did say that they are not ruling out the work of The Order, who may be trying to derail the frail peace process in Sirius.

#### Shots Fired on Bretonian Soil
> Conflict broke out in Omega today as Rheinland ships, becoming ever bolder, opened fire on a nearby Bretonian patrol in the area. The Chancellor has said that the Rheinland blockade is only looking after Rheinland’s interests in the area and claimed that they were provoked by Bretonian fighters. As tempers flare and peace hangs in the balance, Queen Carina contemplates her next move with her advisors.

#### Are There Changes in Rheinland?
> News from the Foreign Office indicates that things may be heating up in Rheinland. Reports from the inside say that Rheinland citizens are being stirred up against Kusari by what is being described as “agitator groups.” Meanwhile, the Chancellor has just announced that the military is now activating its reserve fighters to bolster homeland defense. Royal analysts have reported this information to the Queen and have advised her that Rheinland may be preparing for war.

#### Queen to Attend Summit
> Despite Rheinland’s recent aggressive stance and the assassination of Lord Quigley, the Curaçao summit meeting is still set to proceed. In a surprise move, Queen Carina will now join President Jacobi and other representatives at the table, taking her cousin’s place.

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Who Killed Lord Quigley?
> As national mourning continues for Lord Quigley, so does the manhunt for those responsible for his murder. Authorities, still tight-lipped about their investigation, have recently ruled out the involvement of many domestic suspects. This only further fuels local speculation that The Order may be directly responsible for Quigley’s death. However, we are told that this might not necessarily be the case. Based on new evidence, investigators are examining a host of foreign leads to find Quigley’s killers before they can act again.
