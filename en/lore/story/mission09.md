## Mission Available

Once this mission becomes available, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Kusari-biased perspective.

#### RHEINLAND ATTACKS!
> Even as Shogun Edo considered Chancellor Niemann’s peace proposal and tensions along the Rheinland border appeared to ease, several Rheinland heavy cruisers and ships suddenly attacked Kusari forces, destroying at least one ship and killing over 100 soldiers. As a result of this unprovoked act, Shogun Edo has declared an open state of hostility with Rheinland — a precursor to war.

#### Kusari Border Fortified
> With the escape of the attacking Rheinland ships back over the border, the Shogun has ordered immediate reinforcements to prevent any further assaults as offensive forces begin to mass. The Shogunate cautions that all ships passing through Kusari space are now subject to search and seizure. Travel outside of Kusari-controlled zones is not advised at this time for citizens.

#### Liberty’s Bonnerille Dead?
> Word has surfaced here that Aemon Bonnerille, Director of the LSF, is missing and feared dead. There is no further information available at this time.

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Kusari-biased perspective.

#### RHEINLAND ATTACKS LIBERTY!
> In what has been described as an “intolerable act of open aggression,” warships from Rheinland attacked targets deep within the New York system today. Shortly thereafter, President Jacobi announced that she now had no choice but to declare war on Rheinland. Though she declined to answer specific questions, she did confirm that some Liberty military interests may have been affected by the attacks.

#### Zone 21 Target of Attack
> Intelligence sources have confirmed that the Rheinland attack on Liberty centered around a military installation deep within the restricted area of Zone 21 in the New York system. In response, Liberty deployed a significant defensive perimeter around New York, including many heavy military vessels that are patrolling the perimeter of Zone 21.

#### Bretonia Remains Vigilant
> Bretonian news feeds are reporting that the government is preparing for any movement against them by Rheinland forces, but as of yet, no attacks have occurred. However, tensions are mounting as several thousand anti-war demonstrators protest outside the Queen’s estate. No one was seriously hurt when riot police finally dispersed the demonstration.

#### Missing Ship’s Last Message
> Sources say an Artifact-laden Bretonian ship, reported lost, was apparently attacked somewhere near Leeds. Bretonian investigators have reportedly discovered a weak transmission fragment that is believed to be the ship’s last message. What appears to disturb authorities the most about this fragment is the mention of “unmarked ships” that had come into range just before losing contact. As Bretonia continues to investigate, speculation here at home rises over recent ship disappearances.
