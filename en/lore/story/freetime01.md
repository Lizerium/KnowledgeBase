After ending Mission 1 the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Reaction to FP7 Investigation
> Other voices in Sirius have begun to question Liberty’s move to place military forces in what has always been an apolitical, neutral zone. Some have said that this investigation should be an open, pan-colonial undertaking and that the stationing of military forces in Sigma-17 violates charter settlement agreements between the Houses and other factions. To assuage these concerns, President Jacobi spoke, insisting that the recent movement of The Order required immediate action. She also stated that our forces were there to prevent further contamination of the area and to execute a thorough investigation — nothing more. Jacobi went on to stress that our formal presence at the Freeport 7 site would be exclusive and temporary, and that the sum of the findings would be shared with all affected government agencies.

#### New York Crime Wave on the Rise?
> Are we at greater risk at home now more than ever? That’s the question. When The Order penetrated our defenses to kill Otto Schultzky nearly on the very steps of the presidential palace, many of our illusions about our own security were affected. Add to this the destruction of Freeport 7 and the sharp increase of attacks by the Liberty Rogues in New York, and we begin to feel anxiety and uneasiness about our personal and economic security. The President and the LSF say that they are addressing these concerns, but without concrete results, we are still left asking the questions, “Are these events related? And what can we do about The Order?”

#### Niemann Blames Liberty for Death
> Chancellor Niemann of Rheinland spoke out bitterly today, citing lax security and blaming Liberty for the recent death of Admiral Schultzky during his visit. Niemann went on to say that he would personally punish those responsible, regardless of where they hide.

#### FP7 Survivors to Talk
> Manhattan — Doctors at the WCMC have given the go-ahead for special LSF investigators to interview many of the Freeport 7 survivors. Despite an earlier recommendation against this course of action, we are told that government pressures have motivated physicians to allow at least a conditional line of questioning of select patients. It is hoped that their eyewitness testimony will help to shed some light on who truly is responsible.

#### Local Crime Ring Smashed
> Seemingly in answer to growing security concerns, LSF forces took action and delivered a crushing blow to Liberty Rogues operating secretly near Pittsburgh. Following up on details from an ongoing investigation, the well-hidden base was rooted out and surgically eliminated by agents who acted under tactical LSF authority. Aemon Bonnerille of the LSF promises that this is just the beginning, as he intends to “tighten the noose around the neck of organized crime.”

#### Local Prison Ship Rescued
> Just before LSF fighters closed in on a secret Rogue base near Pittsburgh, they were instrumental in fighting off a coordinated attack on a local prison ship. Prison Ship XT-19 is generally used as a staging area for prisoners being shuttled between processing stations and more permanent lockdowns in Texas. It was during such a transfer that the Rogues suddenly attacked and overran its defenses. Authorities believe that the Rogues were attempting to liberate a group of its own members being interrogated on board. Fortunately, however, the LSF arrived just in time to repel the pirates and avert disaster. Though XT-19 sustained heavy damage, we are told that the ship was successfully towed to Baltimore Shipyard for repairs.
