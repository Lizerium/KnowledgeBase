### News
Those news are displaying a possibly `Liberty-biased` perspective.

#### Arrival of Freeport-7 Survivors
> Just moments ago, the survivors of the `Freeport-7` disaster arrived here in Manhattan. After two days of intense travel, several of the survivors required immediate medical attention. Requests by the LSF to conduct interviews concerning the attack have been declined by the medical commissioner. Meanwhile, the official death toll has risen to 2,600, making it the most `devastating disaster in recent history`.

#### Rheinland Admiral in Manhattan
> Rheinland Admiral `Otto Schultzky` arrives in Manhattan today to meet with President Jacobi. Though they plan to discuss a new trade proposal, the President says that a heightened cooperative security measure will be on their agenda as well in light of the recent Freeport-7 `tragedy`.

Kusari had proposed a `“full disclosure”` initiative, which was `protested` and then effectively `blocked` by Rheinland. Recent territorial disputes in the Border Worlds, largely driven by the discovery of a wealth of new resources and `Artifacts`, have sparked these talks between the colonies, with `Liberty` acting as mediator. However, with the delegates now polarized over this issue, it is unclear how effective these talks will be.

#### Military to Investigate Freeport-7
> Government sources say that because of The `Order’s` potential involvement, President Jacobi has put the investigation of `Freeport-7` into the hands of a special unit within the Liberty Military. This corps of investigators will be `charged with securing` the wreckage, gathering evidence, and coordinating with forensic teams in the solemn task of recovering an
