### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Kusari-biased perspective.

#### Tekagi Departs for Rheinland
> Concern is high for the Governor’s safety as he journeys to meet with Chancellor Niemann over the issue of the illegal detention of our people. President Jacobi says that she has confidence that a settlement will be reached with Rheinland, cautioning that any action taken against the visiting Governor would be met with swift retaliation from both Liberty and Bretonia.

#### Special Guard Escorts Tekagi
> Governor Tekagi is meeting with Chancellor Niemann under the protection of the Shogun’s own Imperial Guard, who accompanied him through the blockade and to the Rheinland capital of New Berlin. The Governor was greeted with unusual warmth by the Rheinland Chancellor, who was himself surrounded by his own well-armed bodyguards. The two reportedly are going to meet privately to discuss the peace settlement and the safe release of the Kusari hostages. Today, all eyes are on Rheinland.

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Kusari-biased perspective.

#### Tekagi Returns in Triumph
> Governor Tekagi returned home after an extended meeting with Chancellor Niemann on New Berlin. While the fatigue of the journey appears to have taken its toll on the usually animated Governor, the meeting itself was reportedly a success. As a goodwill gesture, the Governor returned with 150 Kusari citizens who had been held hostage in Rheinland. The rest, we are told, will be returned in stages.

#### Hostages Being Debriefed
> Governor Tekagi met privately with Shogun Edo immediately upon his return from New Berlin. There is no formal word yet from this meeting. Meanwhile, Intelligence officials have reportedly begun the process of debriefing the recently returned hostages. It is hoped that they will be reunited with their families and co-workers very soon.

#### Kusari Transport Lost
> With no clues to its disappearance, officials have classified the transport that recently failed to report in from the Border Worlds as lost. The ships and crew names are being withheld until the families can be notified.
