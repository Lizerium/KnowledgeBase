### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Edo Denies Allegations
> Shogun Edo dismissed the Chancellor’s statement that one of Kusari’s own medical convoys was being used to transport an explosive device into Rheinland territory. He warned Niemann that he could not allow this “wanton slaughter” to continue and insisted that Rheinland release the Kusari citizens that they were holding hostage.

#### Device found in Convoy Wreck
> Rheinland officials have presented evidence in support of their claims that the Kusari medical convoy, recently destroyed by Rheinland ships, was actually on a covert “seek and destroy mission.” In their analysis, they discovered that a device, based on a fusion-bomb design, had been cleverly modified using Kusari components to be even more thorough in its destructive power. Meanwhile, Kusari officials demanded to inspect this so-called evidence, denouncing it as a feeble attempt by Rheinland to justify its war-like actions.

#### Edo Asks for Support
> Kusari has appealed to the governments of Liberty and Bretonia in their dealings with Rheinland. Shogun Edo says that his principal concern is the welfare of his people still within Rheinland’s borders. He said that he is receiving enormous pressure to act militarily, but is still seeking a peaceful resolution.

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Rheinland Military Buildup
> In breaking news, large numbers of military ships have been reported on the move in Rheinland and have taken up position along the remainder of their borders. The Queen has taken issue with this action and is being kept apprised of things as they unfold. Despite the atmosphere of apprehension, commercial and civilian traffic on our side of the Gates continues.

#### Travel Advisory for Bretonians
> Eyewitnesses in the Border Worlds say that Rheinland forces have intensified their presence and activities there, largely targeting the pirate population. In light of recent events, the Foreign Office has issued an advisory to all Bretonian subjects to use extreme caution when traveling outside of our systems.

#### Jacobi Warns Rheinland
> In response to the arrival of more heavy-class Rheinland ships at Liberty’s border, President Jacobi has called for the Chancellor to immediately pull his forces back. Jacobi has also deployed her own defensive units and has warned the Chancellor not to enter Liberty space.

#### Market Falters Amid Uncertainty
> Merchants at home and abroad are beginning to feel the economic hardships of our current political situation. With rising domestic strife and increased foreign threats, spending and trade have decreased in many areas, leaving us in something of a slump. Royal analysts say they are studying the problem and plan to offer a list of recommendations by week’s end.

#### Jacobi Proposes Meeting
> In a formal address, President Jacobi said that matters with Rheinland had progressed to a level that she felt required more direct methods. She asked for representatives from Kusari and Bretonia to meet with her on Manhattan to discuss an initiative that she believes will defuse the situation with Rheinland while also allowing for the safe return of Kusari citizens.
