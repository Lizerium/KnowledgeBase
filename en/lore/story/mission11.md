## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Liberty President Missing
> Liberty feeds are buzzing with news that President Jacobi may be missing. Local LPI and LSF authorities were called to her residence where a violent struggle appears to have occurred shortly before dawn. Despite concerns that The Order may be involved, LSF Director Aemon Bonnerille says that he will do everything in his power to find the President.

#### Coup in Liberty Reported
> Officials inside the Ministry of Truth say that there is every reason to believe that President Jacobi has fallen victim to a coup. The military leadership that is acting in her absence has full control of the government and is considering action against Kusari.

#### Shogun’s Reaction
> In a carefully worded statement, the Shogun voiced his concerns that even “temporary military leadership” in Liberty might signal rough changes for Kusari. Reports indicate that several military leaders have echoed what could be construed as pro-Rheinland sympathies, which could shift the balance of power in the already tense conflict.

#### President Jacobi Dead?
> President Jacobi of Liberty is missing and presumed dead. Calling it a “national emergency,” forces of the Liberty Navy have stepped in and taken control of all vital government and communication centers. Admiral Bill Baldwin has assumed leadership and established a temporary military government to oversee Liberty’s bureaucracy. No official statements have been issued at this time. However, we will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.

#### Rheinland Rebels Take Out Base
> In a brief statement to Kusari news agencies, the Bundschuh rebels in Rheinland claim that they have assaulted and destroyed a high-security installation that housed illegal secret weapons built by the Chancellery. Naturally, this cannot be verified as of yet. However, a long-range scan does show a sizeable amount of irregular debris and radiation in that area.
