After ending Mission 5 the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Bretonia-biased perspective.

#### Disappearances Trouble HO
> Today in the Home Office, a report stated that missing persons cases are at their highest in years. Compared to other population centers in the galaxy, Bretonia has often been considered one of the more peaceful, and so these numbers are thought to be erroneous. The Home Office has asked for a recount and more information before it officially publishes its statistics.

#### Ballenshine Was Murdered
> Despite Liberty’s official statement that James Ballenshine died of “natural causes,” several entries in his sealed autopsy report detail certain anomalies. In information leaked to our press, it was noted that for a man who reportedly died of a heart attack, Mr. Ballenshine was in fact missing his heart altogether, as well as his eyes and his brain. These gruesome details were apparently omitted from Liberty’s records. However, they now indicate that Mr. Ballenshine was just another unfortunate victim in a wave of recent high-profile murders.

#### Contact Lost with Remote Team
> Communication was lost today with a Cambridge University-sponsored archeological dig in the Border Worlds. University officials showed some concern, but in the absence of an emergency broadcast, they believe that the older communication equipment at the site must have failed. A repair crew will be dispatched to repair the problem.

#### Shooting at Curaçao, Queen Safe
> In breaking news, shots rang out at the summit meeting on Curaçao, leaving one security officer dead. Fortunately, the delegates were safely evacuated, and the lone gunman was taken alive before further lives were lost. Authorities believe that his intended target was Gunther Obst, the Rheinland representative. Though the assassin’s identity has not been released, authorities have confirmed his ties to The Order. The Queen was unharmed in this altercation and remains under tight security.

#### Rheinland Defectors?
> Reportedly, two individuals claiming to have information about the radical and sudden changes inside the Rheinland political machine have approached Bretonian authorities here at home. Requesting asylum and political protection, these people, whose names have been withheld, claim to have barely escaped a Rheinland death squad. As farfetched as it may sound, it seems our government has taken these individuals very seriously. They are currently being held in a secure location and have been granted an audience with the Home Secretary.
