After ending Mission 3 the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Radicals Commit Suicide
> The Liberty Military reports that several subversives and radical sympathizers of The Order have recently committed suicide rather than face arrest. Although the names of these suspects are being withheld at this time, authorities say that they are still part of an ongoing investigation.

#### Rheinland Foreign Minister Dead
> Karl Ettinger, Foreign Minister of Rheinland, was reportedly killed in a bomb blast earlier today. Ettinger was en route to inspect the remains of the Hamburg Station when a fusion bomb, apparently hidden in one of his attending ships, detonated, killing everyone. Rheinland authorities say they are investigating the site of the incident, but since the destruction was so utterly complete, they have little to go on at this time.

#### Rheinland Ships in Liberty?
> Rheinland Military ships allegedly entered Liberty space today and opened fire without warning. The President immediately contacted Chancellor Niemann, who denied that there were any official military units in the area. Military officials had no immediate comment but said that the incident is under investigation.

#### Rheinland Allegations
> Chancellor Niemann is said to have spoken directly with both President Jacobi and Queen Carina of Bretonia about the allegations he has raised against Kusari. Niemann has accused Kusari of backing The Order in its attacks against Rheinland and Liberty, and has now added the assassination of Karl Ettinger to his list of charges.
