## Mission Available

Once this mission becomes available, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Rheinland Station Attacked
> More trouble in Rheinland — this time in the Hamburg system. Sources there report that a scientific research station was looted by marauders and left severely damaged. Investigators deny speculation that The Order might be involved, saying that evidence points instead to a small group of pirates allegedly backed by Kusari interests.

#### LSF Conducts Internal Meetings
> With Liberty’s security in the balance, Aemon Bonnerille said that the LSF was developing a new internal plan for dealing with security issues. Though he declined to share the details of his new initiative, he has scheduled meetings with all key LSF control personnel.

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Is Orillion Operating in Liberty?
> Sources say that there may be a relationship between organized crime and the movements of The Order. Moreover, there is a remote possibility that its leader, Orillion, may be operating within the confines of Liberty under criminal “protection.” Though the LSF has officially downplayed this idea, they say that they are following up on every legitimate lead to exposing Orillion, The Order, and whatever ties they may have.

#### Kusari, Rheinland Square Off
> Shogun Edo of Kusari is said to have taken great umbrage towards recent remarks made by Chancellor Niemann. Edo bitterly dismissed the accusations of conspiracy and espionage, accusing the Chancellor of clouding the issues of his illegal operations in the Border Worlds and his infringement of the Boorman Treaty, which forbids armed aggression between the major Houses.

#### Orillion Death Yields Few Answers
> Aemon Bonnerille, Director of the LSF, said, “I hope that with the death of Orillion, information about The Order’s operations in Liberty and elsewhere will be quickly discovered.” However, with more questions than answers right now, some people feel that the only man who could have shed light on Freeport 7 and other criminal acts was silenced by the LSF.
