## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Liberty-biased perspective.

#### Kusari Fleet Destroyed
> In what has been described as the largest battle ever fought in the colonies, a massive Rheinland attack force completely destroyed the Kusari Fleet stationed in the Honshu system. Led by a group of over 40 Rheinland battleships, the Chancellor’s onslaught on Kusari seems unstoppable. The Shogun has mobilized all reserves, and the Kusari Naval Forces are now desperately attempting to establish a defensive ring around New Tokyo.

#### Explosions in New York
> Incoming reports state that several large explosions have occurred near Zone 21. Although an official statement has yet to be issued by Admiral Baldwin’s new government, conflicting Intelligence reports have Kusari officials openly speculating that Liberty may be in the grip of an internal power struggle. Meanwhile, in related news, there is still no word regarding President Jacobi’s whereabouts or status.

#### Renegade Killed
> In one of the very few official statements so far from the Baldwin regime, the Liberty Navy reports that the dangerous renegade Marcus Walker has finally been killed. Walker, previously a navy Captain and leader of the former Liberty Attack Group South, had turned traitor and openly fought against the Liberty government for some time with his crew. According to the brief report, Walker’s cruiser was destroyed while he attempted to sabotage a naval installation at the southern edge of the New York system in Zone 21.
