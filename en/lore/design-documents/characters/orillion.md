Orillion. It's a name you think you may have heard, but you're not sure. It is in my best interest to not be known, to never be seen by anyone on the outside. No one knows what I look like or even if I really exist, but there is a rumor... a distant rumor spoken in hushed tones... that I pull the strings of the underworld. That I have plans within plans that constantly maintain delicate events and countermeasures to ensure that both the criminal element in Sirius and their opposing government agencies are at constant odds with each other, yet remain in balance. That I maintain the ever-present tug of war of so-called "good and evil", and from my hand I dispense a decisive victory here or critical losses there - yet I always retain some portion of both for the waiting coffers of "The Order". It is rumored that I have ties deep in the halls of power, yet my influence can also be felt on the outskirts of humanity. That from my seclusion, I see all.

As I said, this is just a rumor. But like all good rumors, there lies within a grain of truth.
