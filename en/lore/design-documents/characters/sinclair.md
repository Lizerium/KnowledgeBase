Kendra Sinclair, that's *Doctor* Kendra Sinclair.

You want to know about my work? Heh, that's a switch. Usually people could care less about Xenoarcheology. But, if you really want to know, I'm researching the remnants of a culture that predates modern man by millions of years. That may sound dull to you, but when I'm out there I feel alive.

When I think, as I stand in the ruins of an enormous amphitheatre or walk the dust-filled catacombs of a vast underground network of streets, that in that very spot lived an active and thriving culture it fills me with a deep unquenchable thirst.

I have a thirst for their knowledge. I need to know their story - of who they were... of what happened to them and why. I want them to quietly whisper their secrets to me - out there in the darkness as I explore their cities. I'm close.... I feel like I'm only missing something... a piece of the puzzle... some knowledge or key that will unlock all of their mysteries and lay them open before me. 

...Then all the years of digging in the dirt will be worth it... of being eclipsed by the "The Great Quintaine". Then he will have to admit that I was right and that he was wrong. 

When I find this piece, they will all know.
