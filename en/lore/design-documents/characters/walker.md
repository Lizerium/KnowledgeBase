I've been assigned to the Liberty Cruiser Utah as her skipper for the last five years. My crew and I are stationed in California and together we play a key role in Liberty's defenses against illegal activity, particularly pirates and smugglers. That's the official line, but there's more to it than that... We like to think of ourselves as Liberty's first line of defense. Anything bad from the outside world coming in - and we're there. 

Example: There was this one time, three years ago - we'd received word from High Command that there was a group of Rogues moving a shipment of pirated gold through California. We knew the route and where they were coming in, and we waited. The drop time came and went but nothing was happening. Suddenly, I got this coded message from an LSF operative that our Intel was wrong. The agent gave us new coordinates. I was skeptical at first but the agent's security clearance checked out and HC gave us the go ahead. I moved Attack Group South into a new position -- and surprised a huge smuggling ring. The largest we'd ever seen. They were Rogues alright, but they weren't moving gold - they were moving Cardamine, dangerous narcotic drug, into Liberty. We crushed them that day.

Ultimately, we received a commendation from the LSF and High Command... and that was also my first encounter with LSF Agent Jun'ko Zane. A relationship that we maintain even today.
