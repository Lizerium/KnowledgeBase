title: Edison Trent

For the record my name is Edison Trent. I just go by Trent. It's easier that way. 

As for my background, I've never had much use for the past. I do have my eye on the future, though. And right now that future hinges on my getting back a million credits this guy owes me. It's not entirely his fault, the station we were on got blown away... but a deal's a deal. 

It was a sweet deal, too - a million credits for a shipment of rare ore that I picked up in the Borderworlds. I needed that money, I **earned** that money, I risked my butt for that money. The GMG rep, this guy Lonnigan, was about to finish the transaction when suddenly the whole place started to come apart. Sirens, fire, the works. We couldn't get to our ships and to make matters worse a support beam hit Lonnigan in the head. He looked bad so I grabbed him and pulled him into an escape pod, took one last look at my cargo all spilled out on the deck like that - and then yanked the lever. Five seconds later -- Boom. It was all gone.

We got picked up and taken to Manhattan, in Liberty space. Not my favorite place, they've got rules and regs for everything. But I still have Lonnigan. He's my ticket... as soon as he gets out of the Medical Unit. I have plans for that cash. That's future enough for me.
