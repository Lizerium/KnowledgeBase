Yeah, my name's Hovis. Dexter Hovis. I was once a sad excuse for a human being - like you. Every day I'd make the shipping runs from different ports o'call in Sirius... each time goin' farther n' farther - goin' into and comin' out o' the most dangerous parts of the galaxy... without even so much as a scratch. It's like I was unbeatable... I just kept lookin' for the next challenge, the next thrill. Got to the point that even the credits didn't matter anymore. You make a lot you know, when you go where no one else will. I was pretty sure that I'd been everywhere and done everything - and then, on an old abandoned Bret battleship that the Molly's crippled up, I found "the race".

Asteroid racin' makes your blood boil and makes you feel alive. There's nothin' like the mano a mano struggle of two racers speedin' in and around millions of tons' of movin' rock and ice. -And when usually only one of them survives, it don't pay to be no second best.

Sure it's illegal, but the IMG don't care and no one else knows we're here - 'cept other racers - and they're not tellin'. They hear the callin' too. They come from all over to race each other - and me - to find out who's the best. It's not about the "rat race" anymore, it's **this** kinda race that makes life worth livin'. You ever get the callin' and feel like you got a pair - you look us up on "The Hood". I'll be waitin'.
