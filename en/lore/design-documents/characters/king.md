My name is Michael King, my rank is Colonel in the Liberty Security Force. My current assignment is classified.

I was born in Manhattan and I'm proud of it. I went to West Point, served in the military and was then hand-picked to join the LSF. I am proficient in high energy weapons, triple-blade combat and open space survival. I am also the only non-Kusari Sri-Lhan master ever. 

This, simply boiled down, means that I am a total and complete bad ass.

It's funny, there's so little in my career that I can actually talk about. But with the military's recent declassification of "Operation Triple Spire", and since I don't work for them anymore, I think I can fill you in on some of the details.

On the surface it was a simple criminal weapons facility strike; we had orders infiltrate - then slash and burn. Things changed though when our detachment soon discovered that this particular group of Rogues wasn't just manufacturing small arms, but had built a large fusion bomb that it was planning to take down Fort Bush with. Intel's estimates of the Rogues' size and strength were way off too - and we were surrounded. It got ugly.

For eighteen hours we held 'em - and we lost some good people along the way. Finally, we managed to get extracted - but not before leaving them a "little love letter from Liberty". As we left, we set off their own weapon and vaporized the entire installation with all hands on board. *Mission accomplished as far as I was concerned.*

When I got back, I also took a bite outta the screwtop Intel O.D. who'd briefed us. I assure you his hospital stay was worse than my night in the brig. Needless to say there no charges filed. My people and my mission are what matter to me, period. When I have an assignment, the brass upstairs knows that they either need to help me or get the hell out of my way - because I'm going to get the job done.
