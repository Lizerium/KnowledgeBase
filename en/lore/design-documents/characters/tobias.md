Richard Winston Tobias, Esquire – at your service…

“- I take great care to give you the best deal – anywhere”

I’m a tradesman by birth, like my parents – both of ‘em. I inherited my small shop on Leeds from them when they passed. Since then, I have faithfully cared for our customers... many of whom come from all around for the patented “Tobias Touch”. 

Being devoted to my trade I never had time to marry, though let me say I am no stranger to the fairer sex either. However I knew if I was ever to find a woman to my liking, it would be my desire to have a son... someone fine and strong who would carry on the rich "Tobias Legacy". Well, the wife has yet to appear – though I do have several strong candidates in mind – I did, however, have the boy… a boy named Trent. 

I knew Trent's parents well, I did. A great tragedy... they were cut down before their time in a shipping accident, leaving behind their young son. Well, there was simply no one else to look after him... so in their memory, I took him in and made him my own. I gave the lad a good home and a good trade – but now he’s a young man... with a mind of his own. He's stubborn like his father was. He's gone off to seek his fortune outside of this “backwater place”, as he calls it. 

…Ah, I shouldn’t worry, he’ll be back. -Mark my words…
