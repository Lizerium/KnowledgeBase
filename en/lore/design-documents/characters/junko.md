My name? My name is Jun’ko Zane. What can I tell you about myself? 

You might have heard about my parents, John and Shikoku. They caused quite a stir in their day when they crossed the lines of political ideology and protocol to be together. They both were luminaries from very different houses; he was a test pilot turned political figure from Liberty and she, a woman of great power and influence - even in a male-dominated society like Kusari. We were raised with the best of both worlds.

Today I work for the LSF, in special operations. On the surface my job is just like any other: I deal with bureaucrats, politicos, company men and freelancers.  I have a sworn obligation to uphold Liberty and its political agendas, both foreign and domestic.  However there is another side to this that takes me into the field - sometimes deeply. It's out there that I feel like I do the most good, where my talents really come into play. You may not hear about this stuff in the news, but you'd know it if we weren't out there. If we didn't hold the line.

What can I tell you about myself? Nothing.
