## Information

In `Freelancer’s` development various documents have been created for outlining the world’s story, aspects of factions, and the single player’s script.
Those documents more or less reflect the game’s final state or at least help understanding the story behind how the game’s contents came to be.

| Documents                                                           |

| [Nomad Faction Overview](./nomad-faction-overview.md)               |
| [Opening Narration](./opening-narration.md)                         |
